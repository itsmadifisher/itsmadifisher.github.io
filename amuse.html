        <h1>Funny Stuff</h1>
        <p>I have very dry humor and I know not everyone gets it which is FINE. Anyway, enjoy the things I think are funny.</p>
        <h2>Between Two Ferns</h2>
        <p>I love Between Two Ferns and all of the interviews Zach Galifianakis has done but I specifically like the Justin Bieber one and I hope you find it funny as well.</p>

     <h2>The Onion</h2>
     <p>This website is a silly site that makes up fake news stories about celebreties and politicians and the stories are ridiculous.</p>

     <h2>VINE</h2>
     <p>I think the biggest mistake ever made was getting rid of Vine. So now I relive the best of my days through vine compilations on Youtube. Enjoy!</p>

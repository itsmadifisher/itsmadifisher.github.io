        <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
        <p>Joey Chestnut is the epitome of American spirit and, therefore, is my hero. He expresses his patriotism through absolutely obliterating his competitors in the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, taking place on July 4th, of course. In his last great feat, Joey Chestnut ate an astounding 62 hots dogs and buns in 10 minutes. Joey Chestnut currently holds the title of hot-dog eating world champion, eating an easy 76 hot dogs and buns, and has recently won his 16th Mustard Yellow Belt after winning the most recent competiton in 2023. Joey Chestnut is a perfect example of a determined, hard-working, and perseverant American who strives to remain at the top of the hot dog pyramid.</p>
